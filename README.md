# Game BullseyeJS
Let's explore fantasy mushroom forest theme and learn all the techniques you need to make your own 2D games with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and HTML Canvas.

The repository focuses on the following topics:

- Implement a very simple AI to make the creatures feel alive
- Control the FPS of our game and how to measure time to trigger periodic events
- Restart the game by pressing a button
- Apply collision detection, resolve collisions and use that to simulate physics
- Use the built-in drawImage method to draw randomized game environments and animated characters from a sprite sheet
- Capture mouse position and animate an 8 directional sprite sheet based on the relative position between the mouse and the player character
- Use HTML5, CSS3 and plain vanilla JavaScript to build a game from scratch. We will write and understand every line of code, we will not rely on any external frameworks or libraries
